## MoD2 (Model-guided model Deviation Detection）

Homage: [https://tongyanxiang.github.io/MoD2/](https://tongyanxiang.github.io/MoD2/)

**MoD2** is a tool for timely and accurate detection of model deviation. Given runtime measurements of a control-based self-adaptive system, MoD2 gives an alarm when model deviation is detected.
